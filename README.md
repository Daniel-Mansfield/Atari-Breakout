# Atari-Breakout

This is my implementation for the game Atari Breakout, written in Java-like syntax on Processing 3.
As a student at University of Maryland I programmed this game in CMSC 131 with Professor Bill Pugh.

## Getting Started

In order to run this project, you will need to download Processing 3, or have the capability of running Processing code in Java.
After this has been completed, copy and paste the code provided and execute.
